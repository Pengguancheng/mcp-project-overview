# 更新后的 overview.md

下面是各个文件的详细描述和更新摘要：

### src/cmd/generateOverview.ts  
完整路径: /Users/pengpeng/Documents/13_mcp_server/mcp-project-overview/src/cmd/generateOverview.ts  
The `generateProjectOverview` function loads all files from a specified directory, summarizes each file’s content in parallel using an OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini model, and merges these summaries with an existing `overview.md` file. It provides the full file list and existing overview to the model to generate an updated overview that reflects additions, updates, and removals of files, including full file paths. The updated overview is then saved back to `overview.md`. Errors during the process are logged and thrown.

### src/index.ts  
完整路径: /Users/pengpeng/Documents/13_mcp_server/mcp-project-overview/src/index.ts  
This TypeScript code sets up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server named "project-overview-server" for analyzing code projects using OpenAI embeddings and a Chroma vector database. It registers three main tools: 

1. **vector-add** – adds class/function documents with metadata to the Chroma vector store for semantic search, supporting upsert by file path.  
2. **vector-search** – performs semantic searches on stored documents filtered by query, type, name, or namespace.  
3. **generate-overview** – generates a project overview by analyzing source files in a target directory and outputs a summary file.

The server uses OpenAI’s API for embeddings (requiring the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable), handles input validation with zod schemas, logs actions, and communicates via a standard I/O transport with authentication.

### src/utils/chroma.test.ts  
完整路径: /Users/pengpeng/Documents/13_mcp_server/mcp-project-overview/src/utils/chroma.test.ts  
The code is a Jest test suite for Chroma vector store utilities using Langchain and OpenAI embeddings. It sets up environment variables, initializes OpenAI embeddings, and tests key functions: creating a Chroma collection, adding documents, and searching for similar documents. The tests verify that embeddings are generated, collections are created, documents are stored, and similarity searches return expected results, ensuring the integration between OpenAI embeddings and Chroma vector database works correctly.

### src/utils/chroma.ts  
完整路径: /Users/pengpeng/Documents/13_mcp_server/mcp-project-overview/src/utils/chroma.ts  
The code provides utility functions for interacting with a Chroma vector store using LangChain and ChromaDB. It includes initializing a Chroma store with OpenAI embeddings, adding documents, performing similarity searches, and clearing collections. The setup uses environment variables for configuration and includes basic error handling and logging.

### src/utils/fileProcessing.ts  
完整路径: /Users/pengpeng/Documents/13_mcp_server/mcp-project-overview/src/utils/fileProcessing.ts  
This code provides utilities for loading, processing, and summarizing code or markdown files from a directory. It loads files with specific extensions into documents, groups documents by their source file, and splits them into manageable text chunks. Using a ChatOpenAI-based summarization chain with custom prompts, it generates concise summaries of each file's content. Additionally, it includes functions to read from and write to an overview summary file. Logging is used to track loading operations.

---

### src/utils/langchain.ts  
完整路径: /Users/pengpeng/Documents/13_mcp_server/mcp-project-overview/src/utils/langchain.ts  
The code exports two functions to initialize OpenAI services using the LangChain library: one sets up a chat model (defaulting to GPT-3.5-turbo) with a specified API key and temperature, and the other initializes text embeddings using the 'text-embedding-ada-002' model.

---

### src/utils/logger.ts  
完整路径: /Users/pengpeng/Documents/13_mcp_server/mcp-project-overview/src/utils/logger.ts  
This code configures a Winston logger with custom log levels and colors, setting the log level based on the environment (debug for development, info otherwise). It formats logs with timestamps and colors for console output and files, writes error-level logs to `error.log`, all logs to `combined.log`, and manages log file sizes and rotation. The logger is then exported for use.
